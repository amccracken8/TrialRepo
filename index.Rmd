## Generating a Website through Github/Rmarkdown

1. create R markdown file -> save as index.rmd (must be named 'index')
2. knit to html
3. commit and push to main (both idex.Rmd and index.html) 
4. Go to GitHub repository for project
5. Settings -> github pages
6. select main branch -> save -> publish 

Site should be ready to be published at website address 

$ git status 	- checks current status of repository

$ git add -A 	- adds altered and tracked files to staging area (to be committed later)

$ git commit -am '<message>' - commits changes in staging area with a message (locally not on github yet, still need to "push")

$ git push		- push commited files/changes up to github

$ git pull		-pill any changes from Github down to local repository


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
