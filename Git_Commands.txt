#Core Git Commands in terminal

##Git workflow
$ git status 	# chekcs current status of repository
$ git add -A 	# adds altered and untracked files to staging area (to be committed later)
$ git commit -am '<message>' # commits changes in staging area with a message (locally not on github yet, still need to "push")
$ git push		# push commited files/changes up to github
$ git pull		#pill any changes from Github down to local repository

#checking files form terminal
$ git log --oneline    #prints a line of all the commits you have made
$ git log -3 --oneline #prints the latest 3 commits 
$ git log -1 -p HEAD   #shows the changes that were made in the file. 

#printing text
$ echo 'some "species" text' # returns exactly what you write after echo
$ echo $PS1   #Returns the characters that appear before your command line in terminal. 
$ PS1='$ '    #sets the beginning of a comand to the '$' symbol

#Making text file and adding lines to it
$ touch FileB.txt  #creates a new txt file name 'FileB.txt'
$ >   #Pipe function this will overwrite a ine
$ >>  #this is a pipe that will append a line, not replace it
$ $ echo 'line of text' > FileB.txt   # adds a line to text file "line of text"
$ cat fileB.txt   #prints out contense of any text file
4 echo 'some text' > filename.txt # will create a file with the first ine with that text

##Git Reset (when you make a mistake)
$ ls  #lists files in current directory
$ git reset .  #unstage documents you add to staging area through 'git add -A' function
$ --  # points to a file in a directory
$ git reset -- fileA.txt    #resets just File A out of the staging area
$ git commit -m 'note'      #commits all files in staging area, not the ones not in staging

$ rm filename.txt     #removes a file from the directory

###coppying files over
$cat fileF.txt > FileG.txt    #will coppy all contents of FileF and makes new file 'FileG' with all the information of F in G.
